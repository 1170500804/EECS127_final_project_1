    "*This Project is mainly based on the technique developed by Wong and Kolter: J. Z. Kolter and E. Wong. 2018. Provable defenses against adversarial examples via the convex outer adversarial polytope. In ICML. 5283â€“5292.*\n",

    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be considering a three-layer feedforward neural network with ReLU non-linearity; That is, the network $f_\\theta: \\mathbb{R}^{n_1}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n_3}$ consists of the layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{z_1}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_1},\\vec {\\hat{z_2}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_2},\\vec{z_2}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_2}, \\vec {\\hat{z_3}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_3}\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\vec{z_1} = \\vec{x}$ is the input for the network and $\\vec{z_3}$ is the output of $f_\\theta$ and the parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_2 \\times n_1},W_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_3 \\times n_2}, \\vec{b_1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_2}, \\vec{b_2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_3}\n",

    "## Adversarial Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, it has been found that classifier trained using standard methods are not very robust. That is, although a classifier may perform well when the inputs are sampled from real- world processes (e.g., images of real-world handwritten images), if they are artificially perturbed by even a small amount that is imperceptible to humans, they can easily be mislead. For example, if we have trained a classifier for detecting handwritten digits, an adversary might be able to take an image of a four and slightly change some pixel values such that our classifier now thinks the image is of a two.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the goal of an adversary is to find an example $\\vec{x'}$ that is close to a real input $\\vec{x}$, but is classified incorrectly. (The classifier is assumed to have correct output on$\\vec{x}$.) That is, the adversary wishes to solve the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned} \\max_{\\vec{x'}}L(f_\\theta(\\vec{x'}), \\vec{y_{true}})\\\\\n",
    "s.t.\\; \\|\\vec{x} - \\vec{x'}\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\epsilon \\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technological Process\n",
    "\n",
    "We first showed that **Fast Gradient Signed Method** could be the solution to a **first-order approximation** of the adversarial optimization problem(With code in the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    " Then we formed a **convex relaxation** of the original problem above.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\min_z \\;& \\vec c ^T \\vec{\\hat{z_3}}\\\\\n",
    "s.t.\\;& \\|\\vec{z_1} - \\vec{x}\\|_{\\infty}\\le \\epsilon\n",
    "\\\\&\\vec{\\hat {z_2}} = W_1\\vec{z_1} + \\vec{b_1}\\\\\n",
    "& \\vec{ z_2} = ReLU(\\vec{\\hat z_2})\\\\\n",
    "&\\vec{\\hat{z_3}} = W_2\\vec{z_2} + \\vec{b_2}\\\\\n",
    "& \\vec{\\hat c} = \\vec{y_{true}} - \\vec{y_{target}}\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " After that, we derived the **dual optimization problem** in terms of the **Fenchel conjugates** and solve it by finding expressions for these conjugates. Finally we formed the expression of **Dual Network**, found the bounds of the dual problem and proved its robustness(with code in the notebook).\n",
